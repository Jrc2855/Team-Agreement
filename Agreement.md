# Team Members: John Chavez, Scott Lease, Miguel Fierro, Joseph Nguyen

## Cooperation Plan:

* All of us are really strong in HTML, and CSS. Most of us are pretty weak in JavaScript. Joseph is pretty good with JavaScript.
* Work with Pair programming to let each of us play to our strengths, when we've got something we're happy with, discuss it as a group before we merge to main.
* Professional Competency Improvements: Scott: "All of them", John: "I want to improve my Communication", Joseph: "I want to improve in Communication, being better able to work in a group.", Miguel: "Critical Thinking, being better able to solve problems."
* Check in with each other as a group every two hours during working time to make sure we're all on the same page.


## Conflict Plan

* Finding a middle ground. 
* Kick him off the team.
* Being honest with each other in regards to what we know and what we don't know.
* During group discussions, giving each person specific tasks. Also speaking to them to figure out what the reason could be for their contributions.
* If conflict escalates within our short time window, then don't let issues fester, bring it up asap. If it doesn't become resolved at that point, then run it up the  chain of command (Jacob).

## Communication Plan

* We will strive to be available during typical business hours (9-4 West Coast Time). Lunch will be at 12.
* We'll use Slack for communication. 
* Every hour we'll have a 5 or 10 minute break.
* Work overtime, get TA's involved if we're falling behind because we're stuck.
* During meetings, going around the table and checking if everyone has something to say.
* Hearing everyone out, Nothing is a stupid idea, Not taking it too seriously, try to have fun with it.
